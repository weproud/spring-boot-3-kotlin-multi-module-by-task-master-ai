# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Caching Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement caching to improve application performance
# Details:
1. Add Spring Cache dependency
2. Configure cache in application.properties/yml
3. Implement Redis caching in the framework.redis module
4. Add @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict annotations to relevant methods
5. Implement cache eviction strategy

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests to verify caching behavior, measure performance improvements, and ensure cache consistency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add Spring Cache and Redis dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the necessary dependencies for Spring Cache and Redis to the project's build configuration file.
### Details:
Add spring-boot-starter-cache and spring-boot-starter-data-redis dependencies to the pom.xml or build.gradle file. Ensure that the versions are compatible with the current Spring Boot version used in the project.

## 2. Configure Redis and cache settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Configure Redis connection properties and cache settings in the application configuration files.
### Details:
In application.yml or application.properties, configure Redis host, port, password (if needed), and connection pool settings. Define cache names, time-to-live (TTL) values, and other cache-specific configurations. Create a CacheConfig class with @EnableCaching annotation to enable Spring's caching infrastructure.

## 3. Implement Redis cache manager in framework.redis module [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create a Redis cache manager implementation in the framework.redis module to handle distributed caching.
### Details:
Implement a RedisCacheManager bean that configures RedisCacheConfiguration with appropriate serialization/deserialization strategies. Set up key prefixes, TTL values, and cache null values handling. Implement custom key generators if needed for complex cache keys. Configure cache error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## 4. Apply cache annotations to service methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Add appropriate cache annotations to service methods to enable caching of frequently accessed data.
### Details:
Identify methods that would benefit from caching (read-heavy operations, computationally expensive methods, methods with stable return values). Add @Cacheable annotations with appropriate cache names and key expressions. Use @CachePut for methods that update cached data. Implement conditional caching using the condition and unless attributes where appropriate.

## 5. Implement cache eviction strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Develop a comprehensive cache eviction strategy to maintain data consistency and manage memory usage.
### Details:
Add @CacheEvict annotations to methods that invalidate cached data. Implement scheduled cache eviction for time-sensitive data using @Scheduled methods with @CacheEvict(allEntries=true). Create a cache management endpoint for manual cache clearing operations. Implement cache entry listeners to react to Redis events for advanced cache synchronization in distributed environments.
