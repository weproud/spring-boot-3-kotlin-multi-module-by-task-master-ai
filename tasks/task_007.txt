# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Service Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create service classes to implement business logic
# Details:
1. Create service interfaces in the domain layer
2. Implement service classes in the data layer
3. Use dependency injection for repositories
4. Implement transaction management
5. Add business logic and data transformation

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for service classes, mocking dependencies. Test transaction rollback scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Service Interfaces in Domain Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create service interfaces in the domain layer that define the contract for user management operations
### Details:
Create interfaces for UserService, AuthenticationService, and ProfileService in the domain layer. UserService should define methods for user registration and management. AuthenticationService should define methods for login, logout, and token validation. ProfileService should define methods for profile retrieval and updates. Each interface should use domain entities as parameters and return types.

## 2. Implement Repository Dependency Injection [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Set up dependency injection for repositories that will be used by service implementations
### Details:
Create a configuration class that registers repositories as injectable dependencies. Define constructor injection in service implementations to receive repository instances. Use appropriate DI annotations based on the framework (e.g., @Autowired for Spring). Ensure repositories are properly scoped (singleton by default).

## 3. Implement Core User Management Services [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create concrete service implementations for user registration and authentication
### Details:
Implement UserServiceImpl and AuthenticationServiceImpl classes in the data layer. Add business logic for user registration including validation, password hashing, and duplicate checking. Implement login functionality with credential verification and token generation. Add logout functionality to invalidate tokens. Implement proper error handling with domain-specific exceptions.

## 4. Implement Profile Management Services [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create concrete service implementations for profile management and password changes
### Details:
Implement ProfileServiceImpl in the data layer. Add methods for retrieving user profiles, updating profile information, and changing passwords. Include validation logic for profile updates and password changes. Implement security checks to ensure users can only access their own profiles unless they have admin privileges.

## 5. Implement Transaction Management [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Add transaction management to service methods to ensure data consistency
### Details:
Apply transaction management annotations to service methods that modify data (@Transactional). Configure transaction boundaries and propagation behaviors. Implement proper exception handling to ensure transactions are rolled back on errors. Add logging for transaction events. Consider implementing compensating transactions for complex operations that might fail partially.
